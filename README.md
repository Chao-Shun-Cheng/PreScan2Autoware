# PreScan2Autoware
This projecy is to develop a combination of different development vehicle simulation analysis and implementation software including PreScan, Matlab/Simulink and ROS/Autoware environment to facilitate the development of self-driving networked vehicle systems and develop application examples.  
## Achievement
1. Point cloud data from PreScan transforms to ***sensor_msgs/PointCloud2***
2. Image data from PreScan transforms to ***sensor_msgs/Image***
3. Pass TIS information to ROS by user defined message
4. Control PreScan vehicles from command of Autoware
## System Platform
### PC 1
